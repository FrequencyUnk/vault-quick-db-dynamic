###Rotate root user creds###

###In Vault Client
#Command to rotate the root user of PG DB
vault write -force database/rotate-root/postgresql

###Validation###
###In Docker
#remote to postgres container
docker exec -it postgres bash
#attempt to login as root user with old password
psql -h postgres.host.address -p 5432 -U root postgres

##Expected output
##Password for user root:

#The old password should fail
#Note that only Vault knows the root password now
#Therefore create another super user dedicated solely for Vault usage
